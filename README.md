2023-24 CST3130 Advanced Web Development with Big Data
Coursework 1: Price Comparison Website

You build a price comparison website that displays products and their prices from several different 
websites.
• The user can search for products on the website.
• Shopping functionality and customer registration/login are not required. 
• Your website provides links that enable users to navigate to the product on the original website.
• You can propose a different type of project based on scraped data from multiple websites - for example a 
property search website.
• Website scraping must be done using Java.
• You must use a SQL database to store your data. MySQL or MariaDB is recommended.
• Several threads should be used to download data.
• There are marks for using Spring, Hibernate and Maven.
• The back end of the website must be implemented in JavaScript running on Node.js. No marks are 
available for functionality that is implemented in other programming languages.
• Your application includes a REST API. This can be integrated into your front end (via AJAX). Or it can be a 
separate web service that enables third parties to access your data.
• The front end must be written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You cannot write an app.
• There are marks available for the quality and quantity of data that you have scraped.
• Marks are available for code quality, unit testing and the front end of the website.
• The final submission of your project must include a video demonstration that shows all the functionality
